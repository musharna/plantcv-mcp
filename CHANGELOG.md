## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-28

Phase 1. PlantCV exposed as an MCP **measurement instrument**: the model proposes a
segmentation, the server returns the numbers _and the overlay it measured_.

### Added

- Four MCP tools:
  - `list_methods()` — available segmentation channels and methods, plus the resolved
    PlantCV version and guidance on which channel suits which image.
  - `suggest_segmentation(image_path, channel="a")` — a colourspace contact sheet and an
    auto-threshold contact sheet, so the channel/method choice is informed rather than
    blind. The server never picks silently.
  - `segment(image_path, channel, method)` — mints a `session_id` and returns the overlay
    image alongside mask diagnostics (mask fraction, component count, major-object count,
    largest area) and any fired warnings. Returns **no traits**.
  - `measure(session_id)` — plant traits with units for a segmentation `segment` produced.
- **Degeneracy gate.** `measure` refuses to return traits on an empty or degenerate mask
  (zero connected components, zero largest-component area, or mask fraction below 0.1% of
  the frame), raising `DegenerateMaskError` with the mask fraction and a re-segmentation
  suggestion instead.
- **Multi-specimen warning** when two or more connected components each reach at least 25%
  of the largest component's area — a whole-image ROI would merge them into one "plant"
  and every size trait would describe the group.
- **Frame-clipping warning** when mask pixels touch any of the four frame edges, flagging
  that size traits are a lower bound rather than a measurement.
- **Session store** with LRU eviction (default 8 sessions), holding a copy of the mask and
  the image path rather than the decoded RGB image.
- `ImageChangedSinceSegmentationError` — `measure` re-reads the image from disk and refuses
  to proceed if its shape no longer matches the mask's, rather than silently applying a
  stale mask or letting PlantCV raise an opaque `IndexError`.
- Overlay and contact-sheet downscaling is always **reported** in the response
  (`overlay_scale`, `colorspace_sheet_scale`, `threshold_sheet_scale`), never silent.
- 47 tests, including a real-execution integration test over a tracked fixture render and
  determinism checks across repeat runs.
- `docs/MUTATION-CHECKS.md` — the mutants each guard test was confirmed to go red against.
- Continuous integration: lint, format check, and the full suite on Python 3.11, 3.12 and
  3.13; a packaging job that asserts the sdist ships `NOTICE`/`LICENSE`/`CHANGELOG.md` and
  leaks none of `.superpowers`, `docs/superpowers` or `.claude`, and that the built wheel
  imports and still registers exactly four tools; and an absolute-path check that runs its
  own negative control so a silently-disabled check fails the build.
- `NOTICE` — attribution for PlantCV (MPL-2.0), an explicit statement that this project is
  unofficial and unaffiliated with the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, and the
  provenance of the test fixture.
- PyPI metadata: authors, keywords, classifiers, and project URLs.
- README sections covering MCP client configuration (Claude Code and Claude Desktop) and the
  server's security/trust boundary.

### Notes

- **`segment` and `measure` are deliberately separate tools.** A single `analyze(image)`
  call would hand the model 17 plausible numbers having never shown it the mask. Because
  `measure` requires a `session_id` only `segment` mints, and `segment` returns the overlay,
  the protocol structurally puts the visual evidence in the model's context before a number
  can be obtained.
- PlantCV's own `in_bounds` and `object_in_frame` are treated as _additional information_,
  never as validity signals: on an all-zero mask PlantCV reports both `True` while returning
  a full 17-trait set of zeros. They are bounds checks, not success checks, so this server
  computes its own degeneracy gate instead.
- The 25% multi-specimen threshold and the 0.1% degeneracy floor are calibrated starting
  values, not constants, and are expected to be re-tuned against a wider image set.
- **The server reads image files from anywhere the host user can read**, with no directory
  allow-list or sandbox, and returns them to the model as base64 images. This is the same
  trust boundary as any local filesystem MCP server, and it is documented rather than
  silently assumed. Restricting reads to a configured root is a candidate for a later release.
- `plantcv` is hard-pinned to `==4.11.3` on purpose: trait values can shift between PlantCV
  releases and determinism is a tested guarantee. `opencv-python` is deliberately left without
  an upper bound, because PlantCV already caps it and duplicating that ceiling would drift.

### Not included (phase 2)

`measure` uses the whole image as its region of interest; explicit and multi-plant ROIs
(`roi.rectangle`, `roi.circle`, `roi.auto_grid`) are not yet exposed — which is why the
multi-specimen warning can only advise, not correct. Also deferred: mask refinement
(`refine`), morphology traits (leaf insertion/tangent angles, stem, skeleton segments),
batch processing, and hyperspectral/thermal imaging.
